Okay Team:

Goals:

***MVP:***
1. **Mobile App**  
    *Button to feed*  
        If Button pressed it turns motor and feeds animal (Nick)

4. **Have Camera that shows in front of feeder**  
    *Store recorded video (24h)*  

5. **Speaker functionality**

Feed Cat  

Feed Dog  

***Things to Consider***  
*- Express back end, React Front end?*  
*- What kind of DB would we store the recorded video information on? Store last fed data, or 30 day record etc.*  
*- How will our app interact/communicate with Raspbian?*  
*- What kind of database do we need?*  


Good work Team
